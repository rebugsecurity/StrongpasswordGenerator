# passwordgenerator
In this code, we are using the secrets module, which is introduced in Python 3.6 and provides a secure way to generate cryptographically secure random numbers and strings. We are also using the string module to define the characters that can be used in the password, which includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation.

The generate_password() function takes an optional argument length which specifies the length of the password to be generated (default is 12). It uses secrets.choice() function to randomly select characters from the defined alphabet and concatenates them to create the password.

Note that the passwords generated by this code are truly random and can be used for various security purposes. However, it's important to store and handle passwords securely, following best practices such as hashing and salting, and not storing them in plain text.

# Usage
``python3 passgen.py`` <- It should work like that.
